1. Project Overview:

The contents of the project analyze a range of different types of creative projects, such as music, games, and movies, that require funding and analyze the success of the funding for the projects. These projects are supposedly new and innovative ideas that require a certain amount of funding (the goal) to create a product that can be used and perhaps enhanced with further support after they are created. The data provided takes each product and depicts the success or failure of the funding. It shows the total amount of support and actual raised funds to aid with the creation of the product. From this data set, we are able to see the different types of products and the amount that is needed to be created. With this information we are able to see if the funding was a success or a failure based by comparing the goal to the actual raised funds. 

2. Analysis of Outcomes by Date:

In the analysis of this data set, we can take the different categories of creative projects and see the success and failures of each one. We first created a pivot table adjusting the data with different categries displaying the different values to see the impact of different variables determining the success or failure of the projects. One of the ways that we determined the success and failure of these different projects were by organizing them by date. 

2.1 Line Graph of Theater outcomes by Date:

When taking a look at this graph, we can see a trend in the outcomes of the Theater category of these projects. The data set provided ranges from years 2009 to 2017. We can see an increasing amount of theater projects starting from 2009 to 2015. At 2015, the amount of successful creative projects dealing with theaters that required funding peaked at nearly 300. Although the total amount of projects peaked, it shows that the percentage of successes closely followed with failed attempts. 

2.3 Line Graph of Music Outcomes by Date:

Comparing music to the theater category, we can see that it peaked in 2012 instead of 2015. The biggest difference comes from the amount of sucessful fundings versus the amount of cancelled and failed projects. The amount of success was not as closely followed with other failed projects meaning that perhaps the barriers of entry to the music industry was much lower than theater. 

2.4 Line Graph of Publishing Outcomes by Date:

When we take a look at publishing of books, we can see that the success of these are extremely rare, and exactly on 2015 where theater was thriving, publishing was in its worst time, where funding was hard to find and many projects did not receive enough to be created.

2.5 Conclusion from analysing with Date:
When we analyze the data using the date based on years, we can see the different trends that different categories had and even compare them to different categories. Many companies can take this data and use it to make a decision on what type of products and projects they want to take on to generate the most support. They are not only able to take a look at the success to failure ratio of a certain category, but they are also able to compare different cateogries and determine which one is more successful based on the time period.
